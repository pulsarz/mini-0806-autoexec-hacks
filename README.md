## Set superfine to 24Mbit without flashing a modified firmware
You can find this script in the auto_24Mbit folder. Place the autoexec.ash file on the root of your sd card and boot it up.

## Rotate between 6Mbit and 24Mbit for simple parking guard
You can find the scripts in the rotate_on_boot folders. Place both .ash files on the root of your sd card.
When you boot up the first time it'll be in 6Mbit mode. When you turn the dashcam off and on it'll switch to 24Mbit.
Next bootup it'll be 6Mbit etc..

Note: There is also a 2Mbit mode but I really didn't like it, it was just too low for me.
